				<figcaption>A new wave of typology is being introduced to architecture and urban planning. With city population on the rise, units are becoming more compact. With easy accessibility to online stores and online businesses, many are creating their own. To experiment the capability of micro-units, this project opens up to the living with the minimum space in a micro-unit and yet still be able to fuction efficiently.

				<figcaption class="title">PROCESS DIAGRAM</figcaption>
				<figcaption>The design of the unit started with a conceptual stage; researching anything close to nature. This specific project started from looking into forests and overlay spacial characteristics of forests; such radial geometric patterns or axials patterns. Then those characteristics were converted to be used in a spatial diagram of a 600sqft area, which led to different ways to carve out usable spaces. The end process was known as field voids, combining radial patterns with axial symmetry.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>Plan of the unit is fairly simple, ribbons of light separating each 'room' and in the ribbons of program, each ribbon categorized by different activity. Cooking, working, sleeping, bathrooms. Voids in the unit were carved in plan as well as section. The strips of light provide the lighting and shading the unit needs.</figcaption>
