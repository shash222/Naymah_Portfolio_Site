			<figcaption>The screens are made up of crooked lines in contrast to the vertical edges of the windows. They
				filter in the sunlight to make the heating and cooling of the building more efficient. The screens are
				made up of brushed metal and are hooked over the parapet. The windows are also alternating in opaque
				glass made up of back-painted fiber glass and transparent glass to increase privacy some of the rooms.
