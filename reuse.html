				<figcaption><b>PROCESS DIAGRAM</b></figcaption>
				<figcaption>The original building was a 4 story building with two courtyards. The design for this building was to divide the building in 600sqft units and collective work spaces. Some units were removed to create open spaces and some units created more stories to allow variation in hieght. This allowed the every section and plan to vary in drawing. In section, the building is divided in three parts, the section viewed from the street, section viewed from the neighborhood and section in the center. </figcaption>

				<figcaption>The floor plans offer different variations of layout of units and work spaces, in the first floor which is the floor above the ground floor, holds micro-units alond exterior wall and work space in the center. The changes to the original building were very minimal. Only the interior walls were eradicated and exterior walls were intact. The voids in the center and towards the back were part of the orginal plan.
							The second floor plan holds units on all three sections and collective workspace in cantilevered area. The sixth floor plan holds just micro-units and outdoor space on the roof of the buildings.</figcaption>
