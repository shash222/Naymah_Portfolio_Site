			<figcaption class="title">DIAGRAM</figcaption>
			<figcaption>The design of the units were initiated with the thinking of how to use 600sqft and add extra
				dimension to it. 600sqft units were laid out and couple of parti diagrams were drawn. The end result
				created a set of units where the edges of the facades were reduced to create a dynamic facade. This led
				to the units having angled balconies.</figcaption>

				<figcaption class=" title">FLOOR PLAN</figcaption>
			<figcaption>To continue the shared workspace among residences, on each floor, there is a shared work space
				between two live units (decoupled) and live-work unit. The shared space is open to anyone on the floor.
				Each floor is also overlooking the floor beneath. Large community open spaces are spread throughout the
				building where residents can hold parties, meetings, extra work environments. The buildings are
				encompanied by two firestairs and elevators, making each floor ADA aprooved. The plan of the units are a
				one-bedroom; one-bath apartment, with a private workspace for the live-work units. The decoupled units
				have entrances to the shared work space from their own apartment.
