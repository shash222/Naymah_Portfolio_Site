			<figcaption><b>FLOOR PLAN</b></figcaption>
			<figcaption>With approximately 1600 sqft of space, nooks or zones were created serving different purpose;
				such as productivity zone, lounging, and entertainment space. Each zone would also have different
				architectural elements distiguishing itself from the rest of the space.Space designed for young college
				students to working millenials to utilize and call it their own. Another element to this space was that
				a couple times a year the space would transform into an extended prayer area and all existing furniture
				would move to nearby storage. The alternating materials on the floor indicates the rows for the people
				to pray on otherwise volunteers would spend time on laying down carpets and then picking it up.

				its full,
				and the units on the second and third floor are either live-work or decoupled, paired with a set of
				stairs. To
				maintain the linear circulation, the units were arranged with linear circulation with programs at the
