				<figcaption class="title">PROCESS DIAGRAM</figcaption>
				<figcaption>The design for this low-rise residential was initiated with field design. To use linear ciculation, the 1 acre site was divided into 8x3 grid to offer minimum use living space and circulation. The grid was then increased in hieght to offer a natural design to the site. The strips of the site were offseted to offer variation. With the 600sqft units, the site offered a new way to interact and use the space. </figcaption>

				<figcaption class="title right">FLOOR PLAN</figcaption>
				<figcaption>Plan of the units were caterogized by 3 different needs; ADA, live-work, and decoupled live-work. The units on the first floor are all ADA accessibility, so residents with wheelchairs can use the unit to its full, and the units on the second and third floor are either live-work or decoupled, paired with a set of stairs. To maintain the linear circulation, the units were arranged with linear circulation with programs at the side. In the decoupled units, the circulation was meant to lead to the office space.</figcaption>
